## Description

This project is a developer tool designed for the blockchain ecosystem, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The tool provides a seamless interface for developers to interact with the model, offering a range of features to enhance the blockchain development experience. Whether you're generating code, testing it, compiling, deploying, or seeking the latest information in the blockchain space, this tool has you covered.

## Features

- **Code Generation**: Automatically generate code tailored for blockchain applications.
- **Code Testing**: Validate and test your code within the tool to ensure it meets the required standards.
- **Compilation and Deployment**: Compile your blockchain code and deploy it directly from the tool.
- **Real-Time Information**: Access the latest updates and information in blockchain technology through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs).
  
## Installation

Must install cargo, rust, solana.
Must write npm i in all folders.

##External Resources
This project leverages the power of the FEVM (Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine) to deploy smart contracts and store crucial data in a decentralized manner using Filecoin.

User Conversations Data
We are committed to protecting our users' data by storing it in a decentralized manner. The data from user conversations will also be uploaded to Filecoin, following the same process used for the embeddings.
